         Welcome to Amidon!\n
         \n
         No existing settings were found, so you will need to provide\n
         the Mastodon server instance you would like to connect to,\n
         and you can optionally login as well. If you don't login,\n
         you will only have access to the public information the\n
         server provides.\n
         \n
         You can also select the GUI layout you prefer.\n
         This can also be changed later in the application settings.\n
